# Project - Introduction to Data Science - UFMG - 2021/01

Work of the discipline Introduction to Data Science, taught in 2021/01 in the Information Systems course at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).

## Goal
To provide an overview of suicide rates in countries during the period from 1986 to 2016.

## Dataset
We used the dataset [Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016).


## Team
Our team consists of [Guilherme Mendes](https://github.com/GuiMendeees), [Icaro Vieira](https://github.com/icarovie), [Jean George](https://github.com/jeanGeorge), [João Gabriel](https://github.com/JoaoGontijo) e [João Pedro Rosa](https://github.com/jotaRenan).


## Questions to be answered
Below are the questions we aim to answer in this work. Each group member will seek to answer a question.

* How is the behavior of rates across countries over time? How is the behavior seeing the entire continent? Perform year-to-year interactive visualization. (Guilherme Mendes)

* Is there a relationship between GDP per capita and a lower or higher rate? (Icaro Vieira)

* How is the behavior of the rates by age and by sex and how is the evolution of this study over the years? (Jean George)

* What will the next years estimate for the dataset look like? (John Gabriel)

* By decade, what is the demographic representation of the groups that had the highest suicide rate? Take into account that a group would be composed of gender and sex. (João Pedro Rosa)
